# CoreMLIntroduction
This is an example of CoreML or Machine learning. This example code describes the way that how to integrate the pre-learned CoreML Models provided by apple in to your app. In this app i am using InceptionV3 pre-trained model.


# InceptionV3 Model:-
Detects the dominant objects present in an image from a set of 1000 categories such as trees, animals, food, vehicles, people, and more.
You can find this model here https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/


# Steps to run this project:-
1.Clone or Download the project.
2.InceptionV3 file is missing. So you can download the model file from https://developer.apple.com/machine-learning/ .
3.Add the model to your project and be sure that target is set.
4.Run the project.
